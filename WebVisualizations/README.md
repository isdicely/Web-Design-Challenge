Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

Created a visualization dashboard website using provided visualizations looking at the correlations of latitude with: Max Temperature, Wind Speed, Cloudiness and Humidity. 
The weather data was provided and taken from the OPenWeatherMap API.

The repository contains the following folders and files :
/WebVisualizations:
    8 html files
        Project introduction page: landing_page.html: main page
        Four visualizations pages: each containing the visulizations provided with a description
        Comparisons page: contains all four visualizations
        Data page: an html representation of the csv file
    Jupyter notebook: used to convert csv data into html table code
    CSS: contains css style code for the 8 html files
    Folder /Resources:
        Weather data in csv format
    Folder /visualizations:
        Four files with visualizations provided

The 8 html files were written to resemble the screen shots provided to guide the construction of this dashboard. Navigation bar, side bar, and responsive elements added as instructed.
